## Overview

Explore the world of cloud computing and storage with the AWS-GCP Compute & Storage Learnings repository. This project encapsulates hands-on experience in launching AWS EC2 instances, managing web applications, and utilizing the AWS S3 service for file storage. Additionally, dive into the exciting realm of building APIs using the gRPC framework.

### Learning Outcomes

Through this repository, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Mastery in launching AWS Elastic Compute (EC2) instances
- Proficiency in provisioning and configuring EC2 instances to support web applications
- Familiarity with AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and bucket creation
- Experience in working with AWS libraries, such as boto3, to perform AWS operations, including interactions with S3
- Enhanced expertise in building APIs using the gRPC framework
- Insight into Protocol Buffers and their usage with gRPC

### Key Requirements

1. **gRPC Server Development:** Build a gRPC server using your preferred language or framework. You have the flexibility to choose between languages like Python and frameworks like Node.js. Refer to the official gRPC documentation's quick start guides to get started.

2. **EC2 Deployment:** Deploy your gRPC server on an AWS EC2 instance. Leverage your knowledge of launching EC2 instances to ensure your server is up and running.

3. **gRPC Methods:** Create gRPC methods based on the code provided in the official gRPC documentation's quick start guides. Utilize Protocol Buffers for structured data serialization.

### Repository Contents

This repository comprises:

- Code for your gRPC server, built using your chosen language or framework
- Deployment instructions and configuration files for launching the gRPC server on an AWS EC2 instance
- gRPC methods code, structured according to the Protocol Buffers format
